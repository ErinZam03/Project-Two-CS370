# Project-Two-CS370
In this project, I developed a pirate intelligent agent using reinforcement learning and neural networks, implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. I was provided with a basic code framework that defined the environment and offered stubs for key functionalities such as the agent’s neural network architecture and reward mechanisms. Building on that foundation, I wrote additional code to refine the agent’s learning algorithm, optimize network parameters, and implement a robust training loop with proper evaluation metrics. This work involved integrating libraries for reinforcement learning, tuning hyperparameters, and setting up detailed logging for performance analysis.

What Do Computer Scientists Do and Why Does It Matter?
Computer scientists solve real-world problems by designing algorithms, building models, and leveraging computational methods to make data-driven decisions. This project exemplifies how theoretical concepts—such as reinforcement learning and neural networks—are applied to create intelligent systems. The work matters because it not only advances our understanding of machine learning but also provides practical solutions that can improve decision-making in various industries, from robotics to finance.

How Do I Approach a Problem as a Computer Scientist?
I approach problems by first gaining a deep understanding of the domain and identifying the key challenges. In this project, I began by reviewing the baseline code and the specific goals for the pirate agent. I then decomposed the problem into smaller tasks—such as refining the reward function, adjusting the neural network architecture, and improving training stability. By iteratively testing and refining each component, I was able to develop a more effective learning strategy. This systematic, incremental approach is fundamental in computer science and enables me to tackle complex challenges efficiently.

What Are My Ethical Responsibilities to the End User and the Organization?
Ethically, I am committed to developing software that is reliable, secure, and transparent. My responsibilities include:

Ensuring Robustness: Writing code that is well-documented, maintainable, and thoroughly tested, so that the intelligent agent behaves predictably.
Privacy and Fairness: Considering the broader impact of AI systems on users by ensuring that data is handled responsibly and that models are designed to avoid bias.
Transparency: Maintaining clear documentation and commenting code so that stakeholders can understand and trust the system’s functionality.
Safety: Designing systems that are resilient to failures and that can be audited for potential risks.
